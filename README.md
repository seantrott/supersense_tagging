# Super Sense Tagging

## Instructions

First, load `Sense_Tagging.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`. This will first require installing Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

This will load up an interactive notebook to **tag** the senses of different ambiguous words in sentential contexts. When you run the interactive cell, you'll be presented with a sentence, like:

```python
It was a wooden bat.
```

You'll also see a bunch of *definitions* printed for different meanings of "bat", along with their **sense tag** (e.g., "bat.n.01"). Your job is to **copy and paste** the correct sense tag into the free response box at the bottom of the interactive display.

This will continue until you've finished all the items.
